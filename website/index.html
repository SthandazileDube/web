	<p>I, Sthandazile Thubelihle Nkomo the creator of "Crazy.Atist",
		am the illustrator and painter of all the designs at Crazy.Artist.
		Crazy.Artist was created to inspire and uplift the love of art, basically for the ones who see art,
		as more than just a drawing/painting.
		Crazy.Artist offers portraits that are hand drawn with every shading from different kinds of pencils and painting looking surreal on image.
		Crazy.Artist helps you understand the meaning of art without using words,looking at my art and paying attention
		to how I use words is especially great for inspiring how you can use your visual imagination to memorize foreign language
		vocabulary and phrases.Visitng Crazy.Artist will make you aware of many things one being world geography.

	<p>When painting, the expression of ideas and emotions, with the creation of certain aesthetic qualities, in a two-dimensional visual language. 
	The elements of this language—its shapes, lines, colours, tones, and textures—are used in various ways to produce sensations of volume, space, movement, and light on a flat surface. 
These elements are combined into expressive patterns in order to represent real or supernatural phenomena, to interpret a narrative theme, or to create wholly abstract visual relationships.</p><br>

	<p>Drawing is a form of visual art in which an artist uses instruments to mark paper or other two-dimensional surface. 
 Digital drawing is the act of drawing on graphics software in a computer. Common methods of digital drawing include a stylus or finger on a touchscreen device, stylus- or finger-to-touchpad, or in some cases, a mouse. 
There are many digital art programs and devices that I used throught my journey as an artist.</p>
